During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (FCJ)** from **11/08/2025** to **30/11/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.
I participated in **the Flyora project - an e-commerce platform for bird lovers**, through which I improved my skills in **AWS programming, serverless architecture, database management, CI/CD deployment, and teamwork**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
