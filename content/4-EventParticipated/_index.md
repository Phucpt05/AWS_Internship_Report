During my internship, I had the opportunity to take part in 6 special events. These events were not only memorable experiences but also valuable chances for me to gain new perspectives. I was able to learn interesting and useful knowledge that broadened both my professional skills and personal understanding. Beyond the educational aspects, the events also brought joyful moments, meaningful interactions with others, and even some thoughtful gifts that made the experiences even more enjoyable. Altogether, these occasions left a lasting impression on me and became highlights of my internship journey.
