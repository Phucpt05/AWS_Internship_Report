### Week 8 Achievements:

* Gained solid understanding of **IAM** concepts (users, roles, policies) and created a secure access hierarchy for different AWS services.  
* Practiced encryption and decryption using **AWS KMS** to protect S3 data.  
* Successfully built a **custom VPC** with private and public subnets, connected via Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway.  
* Configured **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** to manage inbound/outbound traffic and ensure EC2 instance protection.  
* Deployed EC2 instance with appropriate IAM role and verified secure SSH connection.  
* Cleaned up all VPC and EC2 resources after testing to avoid unnecessary usage charges.  
* Improved overall understanding of how AWS networking and identity management integrate to secure cloud infrastructure.
