> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions
- What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?
  * What I found most satisfying was the opportunity to participate in a real project (Flyora) from start to finish, applying the AWS knowledge I learned to build a complete product. I also truly appreciate the trust from my mentor in allowing me to independently handle important tasks.

- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?
  * I think the company could improve by providing more systematic initial documentation and guidance. Additionally, organizing regular internal workshops about new technologies would help interns get exposure earlier.

- If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why?
  * Definitely. I would recommend my friends to intern at FCJ because of the excellent learning environment, dedicated mentors, and the opportunity to work on real projects. This is a golden opportunity to apply knowledge to practice and develop a career in Cloud Computing.

### Suggestions & Expectations
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?
  * I highly appreciate the current working environment and AWS's intern management approach, so I don't have any suggestions.

- Would you like to continue this program in the future?
  * Absolutely. I would love to have the opportunity to continue working with FCJ in the future, perhaps in a part-time or full-time role after graduation. I believe the environment at FCJ will help me continue to develop professionally.

- Any other comments (free sharing):
  * I want to express my sincere gratitude to the entire FCJ team, especially the mentors who have always supported and guided me throughout the internship. The knowledge and experience I gained will be a solid foundation for my future career.
